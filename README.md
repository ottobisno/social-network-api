# Social Network API

## Description

This application is an API for a social network. Since this is strictly an API, there is no front-end component to this application. The purpose of this app is to provide routes for viewing, creating, updating, and deleting Users and their respective Thoughts (either as a whole or individualy by ID), as well as to provide routes for adding and removing users' friends and reactions to thoughts.

## Usability

To use this application, you will need to use a program such as Insomnia to test the routes with manually created request bodies (where necessary).

## Technologies

- Javascript
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB / Mongoose

## Future Improvements

Add a front-end interface for this application, so that rather than manually putting together request bodies, the user can enter information into a form, which would be handled automatically before fetching the routes from the back-end.
